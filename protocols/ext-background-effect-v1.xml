  <interface name="ext_background_effect_manager_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="background effect factory">
      This protocol provides a way to improve visuals of translucent surfaces
      by applying effects like blur to the background behind them.

      The capabilities are send when the global is bound, and every time they
      change. Note that when the capability goes away, the corresponding effect
      is no longer applied by the compositor, even if it was set before.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        This request sets the region of the surface that will have its
        background blurred.

        The blur region is specified in the surface-local coordinates, and
        clipped by the compositor to the surface size.

        The initial value for the blur region is empty. Setting the pending
        blur region has copy semantics, and the wl_region object can be
        destroyed immediately. A NULL wl_region removes the effect.

        The blur region is double-buffered state, and will be applied on
        the next wl_surface.commit.

        The blur algorithm is subject to compositor policies.

        If the associated surface has been destroyed, the surface_destroyed
        error will be raised.
