## Rule Nombre Uno
never let no one know

How much dough you hold 'cause you know

The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially

If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up

## Number two
never let 'em know your next move

Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?

Take it from your highness (Uh huh)

I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for their bricks and chips

## Number three
never trust nobody

Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up

Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck

She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up

## Number four

I know you heard this before

"Never get high on your own supply"

## Number five
never sell no crack where you rest at

I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em "bounce!"

## Number six
that goddamn credit? Dead it

You think a crackhead paying you back, shit, forget it!

# Number seven
this rule is so underrated

Keep your family and business completely separated

Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch

Find yourself in serious shit

## Number eight
never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too

## Number nine shoulda been Number one to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged stay the fuck from police

If niggas think you snitchin' they ain't tryna listen

They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'

## Number ten
a strong word called "consignment"

Strictly for live men, not for freshmen

If you ain't got the clientele, say "Hell no!"

'Cause they're gon' want their money rain, sleet, hail, snow


Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up

If not, 24 years on the wake up
