## Packages

*I do not maintain any packages, but some kind people have made them for me.*

**If I missed any, please let me know.**

## Notice

Since I am not the maintainer, I cannot guarantee that those packages will always work and be up to date.

***Use at your own disclosure.*** <br>
*If they don't work, try building manually.*

#### Arch ( AUR / -git )

```sh
yay -S hyprland-git
```

## Building

If your distro doesn't have **Hyprland** in its repositories, or you want to modify it, please refer to the **[Wiki Page][Install]** for the installation instructions.
