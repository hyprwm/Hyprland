# Hyprland Render Batching Configuration Example

# Enable render batching (default: 1)
# This groups similar render operations together to reduce draw calls
# and improve performance, especially with many windows or decorations
misc:render_batching = 1

# To disable render batching (not recommended unless debugging):
# misc:render_batching = 0

# Performance notes:
# - Render batching can reduce draw calls by 50-70%
# - Most beneficial when you have:
#   * Multiple grouped windows with group bars
#   * Many windows with shadows and borders
#   * Complex workspace layouts
# - Minimal overhead when few windows are visible

# Example configuration for maximum batching benefit:
group {
    groupbar {
        enabled = true
        gradients = true
        render_titles = true
    }
}

decoration {
    shadow {
        enabled = true
        range = 30
        render_power = 3
    }
    
    rounding = 10
}

# With these settings and 10+ windows, render batching
# can significantly improve performance by batching:
# - Group bar indicator rectangles
# - Window shadows (when using non-ignore-window shadows)
# - Simple rounded rectangles
