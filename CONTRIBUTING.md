# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Hyprland.

To get started, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/vaxerski/Hyprland/wiki/Contributing-&-Debugging) for debugging instructions.

Then, pick yourself an issue or implement your own suggestion!

As Hyprland is early dev, I recommend you stick to the bugs first, then new functionality.

# PR reqs
