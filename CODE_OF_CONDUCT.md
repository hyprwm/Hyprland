## Goal

Our goal is to provide a space where it is safe for everyone to contribute to,
and get support for, open-source software in a respectful and cooperative
manner.

We value all contributions and want to make this organization and its
surrounding community a place for everyone.

As members, contributors, and everyone else who may participate in the
development, we strive to keep the entire experience civil.

## Standards

Our community standards exist in order to make sure everyone feels comfortable
contributing to the project(s) together.

1. **Anti-Discrimination:** Uphold a zero-tolerance stance against discrimination. Do not engage in any form of harassment, discrimination, or mistreatment based on protected traits, including but not limited to sex, religion, race, appearance, gender, identity, nationality, sexuality, disability, socioeconomic status, immigration status, age, or political affiliation.

2. **Intersectional Equity:** Embrace intersectionality by acknowledging the intersections of identity and experience. Recognize that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination simultaneously, such as those related to race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic background. Be mindful of the unique challenges they encounter.

3. **Cultural Sensitivity:** Show profound respect for diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. Avoid cultural appropriation, stereotypes, or insensitive comments. Foster an environment that celebrates cultural diversity and promotes cross-cultural understanding.

4. **Gender-Inclusive Language:** Utilize gender-inclusive language and respect individuals' preferred pronouns. This practice reflects the principles of queer theory, which challenge normative views of identity and sexuality while promoting inclusivity and recognition of the full spectrum of gender identities.

5. **Amplify Marginalized Voices:** Actively seek to amplify the voices of marginalized and underrepresented contributors. Acknowledge the historic and systemic silencing of these voices and work to counteract it. Support initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion within our community.

6. **Deconstructive Discourse:** Embrace deconstructive dialogue that dismantles oppressive structures through critical analysis. Challenge conventional language norms and foster discussions that question the inherent biases within language itself. Engage in thoughtful and introspective conversations that deconstruct power imbalances.

7. **Narrative Disruption:** Encourage narrative disruption, which questions dominant narratives and perspectives. Promote alternative narratives that challenge established power structures. Engage in critical examinations of history, discourse, and representation to create space for diverse voices and counter hegemonic narratives.

8. **Heteroglossic Engagement:** Embrace heteroglossic engagement, acknowledging the multiplicity of voices and perspectives within our community. This notion, inspired by Mikhail Bakhtin's heteroglossia, values the rich tapestry of experiences and viewpoints. Encourage dialogues that respect and celebrate the plurality of voices within our community, fostering a dynamic and inclusive environment.

9. **Accessibility and Accommodation:** Commit to making our community accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. Ensure that digital content and communication platforms are accessible, and be open to accommodating specific needs to ensure everyone can fully participate.

10. **Economic Justice:** Acknowledge the importance of economic justice in our community. Recognize and address economic disparities that may exist, and strive to create opportunities for all members, regardless of socioeconomic status, to engage and benefit from our community.

11. **Environmental Responsibility:** Promote environmental responsibility by considering the environmental impact of our activities. Encourage sustainable practices and engage in discussions about the intersection of environmental justice and our work.

20. **Conflict Resolution Skills:** Develop and encourage conflict resolution skills within the community. Equip members with tools for addressing disagreements constructively and fostering a culture of understanding and cooperation.

21. **Historical Context:** Recognize and acknowledge the historical context in which our community operates. Understand the broader societal, cultural, and political factors that shape our work and interactions.

22. **Community Accountability:** Foster a culture of community accountability, where individuals and the community as a whole are responsible for upholding these standards. Encourage open dialogue about accountability and improvement.

23. **Continuous Learning:** Commit to ongoing learning and self-reflection. Embrace the idea that knowledge and understanding evolve, and be open to revisiting and revising our standards in light of new insights and perspectives.

## Enforcement Strategy

Depending on the severity of the infraction, any action from the list below may be applied.
Please keep in mind cases are reviewed on a per-case basis and members are the ultimate

from people unrelated to the organization, however, the final decision regarding the action

ignoring previous punishments, a member might ban you permanently.
