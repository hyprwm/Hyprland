## Packages

*I do not maintain any packages, however* <br>
*some kind people have made them for me.*

<br>

**If I missed any, please let me know.**

<br>

### Warning

Since I am not the maintainer, I cannot <br>
guarantee that those packages will <br>
always work and be up to date.

***Use at your own disclosure.*** <br>
*If they don't, try building manually.*
