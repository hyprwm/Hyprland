# Installation
I do not maintain any packages, but some kind people have made them for me. If I missed any, please let me know.

**Warning:** since I am not the maintainer, I cannot guarantee that those packages will always work and be up to date. Use at your own disclosure. If they don't, try building manually.

_Arch (AUR, -git)_
```
yay -S hyprland-git
```
## Manual building
If your distro doesn't have Hyprland in its repositories, or you want to modify Hyprland,

please refer to the [Wiki Page][Install] for the installation instructions.
