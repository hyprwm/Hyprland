  <description summary="control data devices">
    This protocol allows a privileged client to control data devices. In
    particular, the client will be able to manage the current selection and take
    the role of a clipboard manager.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

        through the passed file descriptor (typically created with the pipe

        representation requested and then closes the file descriptor.

        The receiving client reads from the read end of the pipe until EOF and
        then closes its end, at which point the transfer is complete.

        This request may happen multiple times for different MIME types.
