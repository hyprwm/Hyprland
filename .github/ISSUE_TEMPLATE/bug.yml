        ## Additional info section

        In the section below you will be asked to upload some files.

        When including text files (such as logs or config), please **always ATTACH** them, and not paste them directly.

        This is important to avoid clutter, spam, and make the issues more readable.
        Thanks for your understanding.

  # The main reason to disallow pasting directly or in a dropdown, is to not clutter
  # the issue with unnecessary keywords, making the github issue search useless.
