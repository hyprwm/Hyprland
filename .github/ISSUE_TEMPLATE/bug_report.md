**Describe the bug**


**Images/videos/anything that would help**


Please attach a log (it's in /tmp/hypr/hyprland.log) and, if crashing, a crashdump (coredumpctl, then coredumpctl info <pid>)

*Please do NOT attach coredumps from any packaged version of Hyprland (AUR, etc.). Compile manually, and THEN attach a coredump of that.*
