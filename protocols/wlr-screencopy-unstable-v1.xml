  <description summary="screen content capturing on client buffers">
    This protocol allows clients to ask the compositor to copy part of the
    screen content to a client buffer.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
    interface version number is reset.

  <interface name="zwlr_screencopy_frame_v1" version="3">
    <description summary="a frame ready for copy">
      This object represents a single frame.

      When created, a series of buffer events will be sent, each representing a
      supported buffer type. The "buffer_done" event is sent afterwards to
      indicate that all supported buffer types have been enumerated. The client
      will then be able to send a "copy" request. If the capture is successful,
      the compositor will send a "flags" followed by a "ready" event.

      For objects version 2 or lower, wl_shm buffers are always supported, ie.
      the "buffer" event is guaranteed to be sent.

      If the capture failed, the "failed" event is sent. This can happen anytime
      before the "ready" event.

      Once either a "ready" or a "failed" event is received, the client should
      destroy the frame.

        supported format.

        If the frame is successfully copied, a "flags" and a "ready" events are
        sent. Otherwise, a "failed" event is sent.

        at.

        The timestamp is expressed as tv_sec_hi, tv_sec_lo, tv_nsec triples,
        each component being an unsigned 32-bit value. Whole seconds are in
        tv_sec which is a 64-bit value combined from tv_sec_hi and tv_sec_lo,
        and the additional fractional part in tv_nsec as nanoseconds. Hence,
        for valid timestamps tv_nsec must be in [0, 999999999]. The seconds part
        may have an arbitrary offset at start.

        After receiving this event, the client should destroy the object.

        instance.

        The union of all regions received between the call to copy_with_damage
        and a ready event is the total damage since the prior ready event.
